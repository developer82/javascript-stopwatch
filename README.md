# Javascript Stopwatch

This small javascript library is an implementation of a stopwatch for Javascript. It was written as a CommonJS module (but feel free to convert it to plain js class if you need).

I wrote this library while developing a new Titanium project and wanted to test my code performance. Since I'm using a similar functionality built in .NET diagnostics, I wanted something similar in javascript.

It's also a good chance for me to play with Github - this is my first project that I share on the site :)
